Cyril, make sure it's good and tight. (pause) Haha, why are we still not doing phrasing?
%
Cyril: Do you think those guys are Doctors Without Borders?
Archer: Yes Cyril, I do. I bet those assault rifles shoot polio vaccines.
%
Cyril: Go where?
Archer: Well long term, I was thinking home. Short term, somewhere that's not the crocodile version of a drive thru.
%
Blah blah blah, some joke about you two having vaginas, let's go.
%
Cyril: Well, you did set the raft on fire.
Ray: Oh my God, you always take his side!
Cyril: I never, ever, EVER take his side!
%
Ray: Crocodiles don't have ears!
Archer: They absolutely have ears, shit-head!
%
Cyril: Why are you so scared of crocodiles?
Archer: Gee, I don't know, Cyril. Maybe deep down I'm afraid of any apex predator that lived through the K-T extinction. Physically unchanged for a hundred million years, because it's the perfect killing machine. A half ton of cold-blooded fury, the bite force of 20,000 Newtons, and stomach acid so strong it can dissolve bones and hoofs.
%
I took three Valium. If I get any more relaxed I will literally die.
%
What? I don't think it's racist to assume that a previously uncontacted tribe of indigenous peoples might react unpredictably, perhaps even wildly, to a bunch of white guys who walk up and hand them a goddamn M16!
%
Archer: Great idea, Cyril.  Let's give an M16 to a bunch of wild Indians!
Ray: Goddamn, Huckleberry Finn!
%
Cyril: What do crocodiles eat?
Archer: Everything! They eat everything! And fear is their bacon bits.
%
Cyril: These guys don't look too good.
Archer: Well, they're gonna look even worse when they're jaguar poop.
%
Ray: You thought I was dead?
Archer: Well, yeah, I just assumed...
Ray: And you didn't even take a moment!?
%
Cyril: What was that?
Archer: Probably a jaguar, excited about being magnificent and crepuscular.
%
The only limit is your imagination! Pew-Pew!
%
Eat a dick, jungle.
%
Ray: How long will it take you, Archer, to admit that you dick around every time we're in danger, just to screw with everybody, because of your complete - no, your utter contempt for your own mortality?!
Archer: I mean, yeah. Duh.
%
Archer: Guys, if we get out of this, the first thing I'm gonna do, I swear to God...
Ray: If you say "buy a tiger," we will beat you to death with your own shoes.
%
La Madrina: So, 900 kilos?
Archer:  However many are in a shit-tonne.
%
Cyril: I'm coming as fast as I can!
Archer: Guys, we really need to talk about getting "phrasing" back in the rotation.
%
Cyril: Is that the army?
Archer: I don't think so. One guy's wearing a T-shirt from a Phi Mew fun run.
Ray: We call them Phi Mu.
%
Are we seriously done with "phrasing?" I mean, not right there necessarily, although "tongue" and "gaping hole" were kinda begging for it.
%
I always worried I would die without knowing how it felt to get my throat slashed and my tongue yanked out through the gaping hole.
%
What's that? I can't hear you over the sound of I have snake poisoning.
%
Ray: We blew up an oil pipeline.
Cyril: Not to mention a bunch of...people.  Compared to that, this is kind of a victimless crime. If it even is a crime. I mean, is it?
Archer:...he said, sucking at being a lawyer.
%
It's not like we're selling cocaine to little kids!
%
Ray: Intel? No, do not compare what we do now to intelligence work.
Archer: Don't worry, I won't. Because selling cocaine to cocaine dealers doesn't really compare to helping overthrow democratic governments, like the US did in Guatemala, Chile, Nicaragua, oh! Iran?! Because, spoiler alert, those didn't really work out so great. But that's okay, because I'm pinning my hopes for the future on the next big shipment of stinger missiles to that rag tag bunch of Mujahidin heroes in Afghanistan!
%
So if you'll hide your vaginas, it's time to gather some intel.
%
Oh, and just so you know, that's exactly how Len Koenecke died.
%
Lana: I'm pregnant!
Cherlene: ...it said, baffling medical science.
%
You think if I had 100 pounds of coke I'd be sitting here playing choo-choo spoon with a tranny?
%
I mean, did you used to be a man?
%
Lana: I want this baby!
Malory: Well, sure, now. Wait until you're waist deep in diapers, he's up with the croup and there's no bourbon in the house. Then fast forward to him knocking up the au pair, flunking out of college, and then single-handedly bankrupting your drug cartel!
%
Lana: It's from a song?
Archer:  Yes it's from a song!  Recorded by Grammy winner and possible Faustian bargain maker Kenny goddamn Loggins!
%
You're important to me, so I made Woodhouse get it from Mother's storage unit...because I own him!
%
Malory: So this whole thing was just a sham?
Krieger: Well, if by sham you mean...sham...
%
Kenny Loggins: You think K-Log needs to pay for sex, do ya?
Archer: No...but that being said, I do think he needs to re-evaluate this whole "K-Log" thing.
%
I don't wanna read about Kenny Loggins. I wanna read about K-LOG!
%
WIC!  It's like welfare but for babies. I don't know, I'm not a Democrat but I think they give you a birth cheese.
%
Cyril: If you finish that sentence, I'm going to rub cocaine in your eyes till you are blind.
Ray: Goddamn, Shawshank!
%
I don't know about you, but I"m gonna be pretty upset if I end up having to murder Kenny Loggins.
%
Jim Messina is a genius and without him? No Poco.
%
Archer:  There's no way a superstar like Kenny Loggins is going to be registered under his own name.
Pam: Yeah ha ha....it's not like he's Messina.
%
Cyril: So...why are we in our underwear?
Krieger: Meh...don't worry about it.
%
Archer: Pam...Pam...
Pam: Whaaat?!
Archer: Danger zone!!  No no no, wait...This is it!
%
Archer: And Woodhouse, if you spend any of that on heroin, you better buy enough to OD on, because...
Woodhouse: Will do!!
%
Cyril, shut your pout-hole, accept the fact that Lana was so far out of your league, that impregnating her would have basically been interspecies breeding, and get on with your life!
%
Ray: Besides keeping everybody up all night with your damn hootenannies...
Archer: Wait, that was a hootenanny?
%
Jesus, these taste like calluses!
%
You think you're not sleeping now? Wait till that thing's born!
%
Malory: Are you bothering them?
Lana: I am. And also, Happy Opposite Day
%
Man, I am blowing this jug!
%
Archer: For what it's worth, we all kinda liked you the way you were.
Pam: Really?
Archer: Well, we hated you less. You kinda turned into a ginormous asshole.
%
How hot am I now?  Let me answer that for you. AS BALLS.
%
Pam: That's pretty ironic, huh?
Archer:  No Pam, once again you're confusing the word "ironic" with "you are an idiot!"
%
Pam: Oh my God, I can't feel my face!
Archer: Gee Pam, I wonder if that has anything to do with your cocaine-only diet!
%
Pam: I switched the coke in Little Rock, cause I was worried that...
Archer: That because of your fat blabbering mouth, Lana would get caught with it and have to have her baby in prison, OR because you were low on cupcakes!?
%
People who like you because you have cocaine aren't people you want as friends, Pam!  And not to sound elitist, but neither are people who need a roll of quarters to take a shower!
%
We're talking about Texas. Somebody somewhere wants enough cocaine to forget they live there.
%
That's gotta be a real knee to the old emotional nut sack.
%
Ray: This quit being funny two hours ago!
Krieger: It's not supposed to be funny.
%
Malory: If we miss that taping, I won't be responsible for my actions.
Lana: Are you ever?
%
We're going eastbound and down!
%
Airplane air is so dry, plus you're breathing in God knows what those tuberculars in coach are...excuse me!?
%
If you'll excuse me, I have to remove my underwear with a blow torch.
%
Lana: Cheryl?
Cheryl: Nah, Cheryl's gone. I'm Cherlene now.   And if somebody don't fry me 6 goddamn eggs and some Carolina fries I would personally be shocked, SHOCKED I tell ya, if by morning this place ain't burned to the ground.
%
I'll be watching you like a hawk. That's been bred with an eagle...to produce some kind of eagle-eyed superhawk...with a badge.
%
Hawley: What do you people think the letters FBI stands for?
Archer: I bought a T-Shirt once that said "Female Body Inspector.
%
You wouldn't know the truth if it bit you on the ass and held on, would ya!
%
So if I were you, I'd run out that door while I still had a chance.  I'd also waste 5 precious minutes of my head start in the race to freedom, giving that swell guy Archer a combination thank-you-goodbye blow job.
%
I was concerned about you - blow me!
%
Hawley: Awww screw me!
Archer: ...said Ripley to the android Bishop.
%
I am totally digging this whole Queen Kong vibe.
%
Cyril: How do you not know the different kinds of porn?
Archer: Because I have sex with actual women, Cyril!  My girlfriend's not equal parts the internet, a tube of Kentucky jelly, self-loathing and a sock!
%
Cyril: You could pose him with Woodhouse
Krieger: God knows he's a little GILF.
%
Cyril: He can't come in without a warrant - well, unless you invite him in.
Archer: He's not a vampire, idiot.  Plus it's daytim
%
The last thing you need right now is a big, shit-eating "I told you so."
%
This is only somewhat like that old gypsy woman said!!
%
Malory: Well, she won't go to rehab and you won't let her die with dignity...
Lana: From an overdose of cocaine cake?!
%
Malory: It's good because it's cocaine!
Archer: Oh my God, and little kids eat it!?
%
Ron: Next time remind me to get shot in the head!
Archer: Ron, next time get shot in the head.
%
Malory: Who uses Metric?
Lana: Every single country on the planet except for us, Liberia and Burma!
Archer: Really - cause you never think of those two as having their shit together.
%
I need my slightly-darker-black black suit.
%
Silence - yes! Aspire to that while I think of a plan.
%
Lana: Have you ever heard a country song?
Archer: Uhhh...Danger Zone?
%
Ah yes. The mind can, in fact, vomit.
%
Malory: What, were the Hell's Angels busy?
Pam: Busy being pussies!
%
Somewhere in this mansion, I have to assume is a gigantic Scrooge McDuckian vault.
%
Malory: Ron, take me to lunch,
Ron: It's 8:30 in the morning!
Malory: A bar then, whatever!
%
Cyril, go lock up the product before Cokey Monster here gobbles it all up.
%
Cyril: I'm sorry, the money is where?
Archer: Uh, in your masturbators, you idiot.
%
You'd be amazed what you people do when you think you're alone.  Cyril.
%
Lana: Right about here is the part where I hold you responsible.
Archer: Oh my God, the burden.
%
Lana: If anything goes wrong, I'm holding YOU responsible.
Archer: Yeah, that'll teach me.
%
Archer: It's the A-Team meets Scarface. That makes me...uh...
Lana: Hannibal Montana?
%
The point is, we are highly trained covert operatives with an extremely dangerous set of skills.  And since the government has unjustly accused us of treason, we are now forced to transfer those skills from espionage to criminal activity. Kinda like the A-Team. But we sell drugs
%
Potato, po-treason, whatever.
%
Cyril: Only if you promise to periodically micromanage it and emasculate me.
Malory: Cyril. I would have thought that goes without saying.
%
God, how I envy the deaf.
%
Think cool thoughts, like eating mint chocolate ice-cream...in your refrigerated drawer...at the morg
%
Not as scary as having to live in "Casa de Addams Family" with you two!
%
Archer: I realize now that I was mistaken
Lana: Aww, what a scary new feeling for you.
%
Archer: Since when?
Malory: Since this new thing called "always?"
%
Lana: I could start smoking crak today and he'd still turn out better than you. 
Archer: Why is that, because I never had a father, Lana? So why don't you shut up and then also marry me?!
%
Krieger: I'll be your doctor. Lana: Well, if I want Hitler's DNA spliced into him, I'll give you a call. Kriger: Yeah, I'm around.
%
FBI Agent: So if I were you... 
Archer: You'd get laid a lot more?
%
Archer: I thought you were gonna shoot me. 
Lana: The day's not over.
%
Well, how hard could it be...if Mexicans can do it?
%
He died doing what he loved...getting shot.
%
Malory: I think I'll start shopping my memoirs!  How does the title 'Secrets & Silk' grab you? 
Sterling: Tightly...by my childhood's throat.
%
Lana: Screw you, Mr My-mother's-a-lying-bitch-and-I'm-too-stupid-to-realize-my-life's-a-pathetic-joke! Archer: Nice to meet you, Mrs Hello-my-kid's-from-a-sperm-bank-since-I-can't-keep-a-man-because-in-addition-to-my-jillion-neuroses-I-have-a-weird-looking-vagina!
%
Cheryl: You're all jealous of my fall-back career!"
Pam: As what, an ACTUAL acorn?
%
You can lie, but your boner can't.
%
Lana, this isn't entirely about race.
%
You really spent your entire inheritence on the poors?
%
I'm Randy Magnum, local Emmy-winning cameraman and nationally ranked pro kite surfer.

Great, the world's first DSVUI.

Something something danger zone.  I know.  I'm not even trying anymore.
%
That's why she hijacked his helicopter?  Talk about rich people problems...
%
Look, auditory hallucinations aren't going to make you any less delicious.
%
Hairy navel.  It started as a fuzzy, but I'm calling this vacation.
%
Archer: Are you kidding, I didn't even let [Woodhouse] go to his own brother's funeral.
Lana: Was he crushed?
Archer: He probably would have been if I told him about it.
%
Lana: Thank you for making me carry your bag through customs.
Woodhouse: No, thank you.
%
Something about nukes in Pakistan.  Or one of the 'akistans.

He's like the PelÃ© of fetch.

The nation state equivalent of the short bus.

Somehow we're in a crazy universe where bonuses are based on merit and not whether you crawled out of your mother.

any idiot can got shot cyril.  Ask Brett.

It's no secret agent, but it's way above architect.
%
Is something burning? Oh wait, it's you because you just got burned.
%
Ray: Should you be smoking in here?
Lance: Should you be flaming in here?  Boom, bumper.
%
Lana: Why is there a camera?
Lance: I assume because this restaurant can't hold 3 million viewers
%
Who am I.  Lewis and/or Clark?
%
I bet $300 seems pretty cheap for a map right now.
%
Are you constantly aware you have regular leg bones?
%
Are you shitting me?  Bionic legs and you lifted with your back?
%
Obviously it's not heaven because Janis Joplin isn't giving me a rim job.
%
Malory: It's like if you've ever seen Jackie Gleason dance.
Pam: Is that a compliment?
Malory: I don't see how it possibly could be.
%
Sorry, that's just a sympathy boner.
%
Sterling: If you don't want to see two robots smashing each other with cop cars and shit as they fight each other through the streets of Manhattan...
Krieger: Stop.  My penis can only get so erect.
%
Shorty over there has a club with lumps on it.  Kicking it old school Bedrock style.
%
Ron: Who the hell is going to sneak in from Canada?
Archer: Arctic wolves?
%
One of carbon's many oxides.
%
My third biggest fear.  He brings home a whore and says "we're married."  Oh and the whore has bangs.
%
Read a book between bi-annual suit case robbings.
%
Archer: How many times do I have to apologize?
Cheryl: Just once would be nice.
Archer: Uh, no.
%
Sterling: I have an El Camino.
Ron: Oh so you're all set. That will hold way more hispanics and lawn mowers.
%
I don't think he's even on this floor, but idiot Bret still managed to get shot.
%
Pam: Should I wash my hands?
Kriger: Eh, I didn't.
%
The last time she was in the field they were still using muskets.
%
Krieger: Do you ever want to walk again?
Gillette: No, because this way I never have to buy new shoes.
Krieger: Yeah, but is that worth it?
%
Gillette: Yes, I piss and shit in a bag.
Krieger: Me too!
%
Ray: Blow me.
Sterling: Why? You couldn't feel it.
%
Now it requires literal leg work, Ray.  Like walking and maybe running.  But hopefully not running because I'll be in brand new shoes.
%
Cyril: I only have two eyes and they were looking for hunters.
Lana: Why, is it pumpkin season?
Cyril: Is that a thing?
%
Wait, does Vermont have liquor stores?  It has to.  It sucks there.
%
Predator only hunts in tropical jungles.
%
Bros before apparent threats to national security.

I will hire Kenny Loggins to play an acoustic sense while I slap some sense into you.

If it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, and murders a bunch of its fellow ducks...
%
Clean the secretly gay for Lucas Troy out of your ears.
%
Maybe I would if I had a peer in this whole building.
%
Maybe you can shut your dick holster.
%
First of all, it's Dr. I'll Solve Your Ant Problem.
%
Malory: Well, you're in charge here. I'm off to get a seaweed wrap.
Ray: I didn't know they made sushi with dried clams.
%
Jesus, Mary and Joseph Stalin! For the last time assholes, my name is....Shazam! How do you not remember that show?
%
Ray: To reiterate, I am paralyzed!
Cyril: Well, join a support group.
Malory: For who? Crippled gay hillbilly spies? There's a niche.
%
Archer: Did you just say Gay G B?
Cyril: Aww...do you think it's the mustache?
Ray: It's not helping.
%
Give it time. This isn't the Flintstones. We can't just wang him in the head with a frying pan!
%
Archer: Oh my God!
Lana: What?
Archer: Michael Gray - was Billy Batson on Shazam!
%
Lana: Have you ever heard of ISIS?
Archer: From the Shazam/Isis Hour TV Show?
%
Ray: Ooh! Here's an idea. Why don't you just saw your God damned head off?
Cyril: Geez. What's up your butt?
Ray: Nothing is up my butt, Cyril. Oh, or maybe there is. I wouldn't know because I'm paralyzed from the waist down and it's Archer's fault!
Krieger: Uh, gettin' some mileage out of that, huh?
%
Malory: Duly noted and disregarded. And I expect you to be totally convincing.
Lana: As the damsel in distress? Have you ever met a woman less damselly?
Malory: Pam.
%
If you're having a legitimate problem with your vagina...
%
Cheryl: Think about someone else for once in your life.
Lana: And that's her saying that.
%
Hello, is this air boats?  Yeah, hi, it's me space bot.
%
Black astronaut.  That's like killing a unicorn
%
You're not fit to be queen of...name a place.

With your looks, maybe bitchy isn't the way to go.

Please you'd do... name a noun

My tongue says sangria by my heart says michelada.
%
Commander Kellogg: Archer broke both of Wu's arms while shouting, "woo!"
Archer: Happy coincidence.
%
I left my lightsaber in my other space pants.
%
It's like a vagina with a zipper.
%
Bring the heavy stuff, those ISIS bastards killed a black guy...I know, welcome to America.
%
Commander: Is mutiny a joke to you?
Archer: I dunno, maybe a mutiny of clowns.
%
Can it be fired with an erection?
%
It has to be your place.  Mine totally reeks of ocelot piss.
%
Bloody mary,  blessed are you among cocktails.  Pray for me now in the hour of my death, which I hope is soon.  Amen.
%
Best sex i've ever had.  That includes Europe, Lana, and my Brazilian au pair.
%
This time really get in there.  All you've been doing is giving one side hell.
%
Archer: Where did you learn all that stuff?
Pam: You know I grew up on a farm, right?
Archer: Really hoping that's not relevant.
%
Your version didn't have coveralls.
%
He was chasing you all rapey.  Fortunately, he's italian so that shouldn't be too hard to sell.
%
Krieger: I needed help disseminating him.
Cheryl: Eww!
Pam: Not what it means.
Lana: Still pretty gross though.
%
Cyril: Every single time we come here we have to help you get rid of a dead body.
Malory: Well you've only been here twice.
%
Lana: Someone is trying to frame Malory for assassinating the prime minister of Italy.
Cheryl: Ooh I bet it's that wicked king.
%
Archer: You have a potato?
Malory: What is this? Christmas?
%
Krieger: Coffee just like I like my women: black, bitter and preferably fair trade.
%
So once again you're left with the class Irish man's dilemma, do I eat the potato or do I let it ferment so I can drink it later?
%
I bet i wont even be able to eat spaghetti and meatballs ever again.  Oh god, I could eat.  Not necessarily spaghetti and meatballs, but not necessarily not spaghetti and meatballs.  I mean I really like spaghetti and meatballs.  Man, if I don't get some spaghetti and meatballs I might literally die.
%
Unless it was the creepy old people bondage sex police, why would anyone break in here and shoot him?
%
Malory: Who taught you to drive?
Cheryl: This guy I know called my dead father.
%
That was for Pearl Harbor!
%
Black, powerful, sexy.  Like if Ron O'Neil was a car.
%
Lana: How much did Dodge kick in?
Malory: Not as much as you'd think.
%
Krieger: Press that red button.
Archer: Is it going to kill everyone?
Krieger: Press that blue button.
%
Archer: Does no one seriously no what today is?
Pam: Tuesday?
Cheryl: The rapture?
%
Archer: And I got to complete my life long dream.
Malory: Meeting Mr. Green Jeans?
%
They called you exotic.  Which is just people talk for awesome.  Which you are.
%
That's racist.  Jingoist.  Whatever.
%
Ouch my eyes.  It's like being shot in the eyes by a glitter gun.
%
Archer: I got to blow up a train.
Lana: Thanks, Gomez.
Archer: Nice.
%
Lana: Please tell me that's a smoke grenade.
Archer: Okay.  it's not though.
%
Malory: Have the porter bring me a cobb salad.
Lana: Before or after we capture the dangerous terrorist?
Malory: Before.
%
My great-grandfather was nuts for skating.  That and the Klan.
%
Armed with what? Pamphlets about Canada's responsible gun control laws?
%
Thanks, Freddy Foreshadowing.
%
Can I just put what I assume is your rock collection on the stupid train?
%
Speaking of excellence, did you hear we met a tiger?  Then he got murdered.
%
Calzado: Crocodiles on a three wheeler?
Archer: Right, how scary would that be?
%
Calzado: Tomorrow i will be hunting the most dangerous game in the world.
Archer: Jai alai?
%
Cyril: And I thought, what would Lana do?
Archer: Not Archer?
Cyril: No, I had to outsmart them.
%
Cheryl: It tastes worse than it smells!
Pam: Man, if I had a nickel for every time I heard a guy say that, i'd have eight nickels!
%
Lana: You're looking for Predator aren't you?  A, he's invisible.
Archer: Not totally, he has a tall tell shimmer.
%
How about you Ironside, you riding dirty?
%
Malory: If you were in my tax bracket, you wouldn't be shouting such socialist propaganda.
Archer: Or wearing such shitty clothes.
%
Ray: You're taking me out of the field?
Malory: Well unless we need someone to go undercover as a shopping cart...
%
I gotta get back to Earth before the Stargate closes.
%
Malory: Especially since this one went and got himself paralyzed
Ray: Yeah, that's me, mr. selfish
%
Archer: New hot tub. 50 jets. Hand hewned California Redwood. No big deal
Burt Reynolds: The California Redwood is endangered.
Archer: So. I already got my tub.
%
Burt Reynolds: You should get a bat pole.
Archer: Nine thousand bucks.
Burt Reynolds: What?
Archer: Lowest quote I got.
Burt Reynolds: Well that's ridiculous.
Archer: For basically putting a pole where the garbage shoot already is already is.  But the co-op board was all like, "where are we going to throw the garbage?"
Burt Reynolds: You can still throw it down the same shaft.  And you'll have some garbage to land on.
Archer: If you're coming in hot it's a win win...
Burt Reynolds: And you were going to pay for it.  No assessment or anything.
%
Archer: It's pretty hard to stay anonymous when you're the world's greatest secret agent.
Burt Reynolds: Well calling yourself that can't help.
%
Random Girl: I have to wait until my friend gets out of the power room.
Archer: Obviously we're going to wait for her, she's the hot one.
%
Pam: I for one an going to watch Hooper until my fingers bleed.
Cheryl: Just tape them up.
%
I'm sorry I can't hear you over the sound of my giant throbbing erection.
%
Krieger can't outrun anything with all that handicap shit.
%
Lana: Don't take this the wrong way, but i'm trying to figure out how you're going to be an effective field agent.
Ray: Interesting coming from a woman.
%
I swear to god you could drown a toddler in my panties right now.
%
I told you I'm not going anywhere, especially not back to ISIS and especially not now that I shot what I assume is the only radio?
%
Noah, I'm half drunk and slathered in every bodily fluid there is... so yeah... this is about as Pirate Kingy as I'm going to get so brief away... Noah... Good Morning.
%
Noah: How much of my blood does he need?
Lana: I dunno, 10 gils?
%
Lana: What's your blood type?
Archer: Who am I Karl Landsteiner?
%
I don't even remember who peed on your sofa.  But if I was a gambling man...
%
Malory: For god's sake woman, where is your pride?
Cheryl: In my work.
Malory: That made be the funniest thing you've ever said.
%
You're so hot for him, I could reheat this chili in your chooch. So how about it?  Chooch chili?
%
Of course i'm not going to be a pirate, i'm going to be a pirate king.
%
Rip: You just killed like ten pirates.
Sterling: Wow, if the five year old me knew that, he'd get a huge boner.
%
Rip: Those could be pirates.
Sterling: Okay, well then they'll do just have to do until we find some cowboys and indians.
%
Sterling: A ruse?  Hi, it's 1930s, can have our words, and clothes, and shitty plane back?
Rip: Let's go, kid.
Sterling: Call you back, 1930s.  And, hey, watch out for that Adolf Hitler.  He's a bad egg.
%
Archer: So excuse me for needing some time to grieve.
Rip: By tending bar and banging newly weds?
Archer: Apparently that's my grieving process.
%
Pam: What a hunk
Cheryl: Total sploosh.
Lana: Yeah, gotta give him a sploosh.
Gillette: And whatever my equivalent of sploosh.  Which I guess is just sploosh.  Only with semen.
%
Did you watch Regis this morning?
%
You know there is probably something I should learn from this but I... AWWW SHIT MY RUG!
%
Archer: Why the hell are you crying?
Krieger: That was my van.
%
One for three off the roof, bitch!
%
Barry: Besides sodomizing my ex-fiancee...
Archer: Only by the strictest legal definition.
%
If I stop drinking all at once, I'm afraid the cumulative hangover will kill me.
%
Lana: Dude, this van is like rolling probable cause.
Malory: All ashore from the S.S. Date Rape.
Ray: Toot, Toot!
%
Does Canada even have a spy agency?
%
Do you like to travel?  Because if you don't find that bag, I will empty the entire contents of your body and use your leathery skin as a replacement.
%
On your knees, hands behind your head, and toss out that weapon!  But not in that order.
%
Archer: You swallowed a pool ball?
Pam: I wish just one and I still got two to go.
%
Archer: I don't need a doctor, Katya doesn't have VD!
Malory: You haven't had sex with her?
%
How is this happy play time? Use your imagines, make a soccer ball out of a dead cat.
%
Barry: Come on, it's your son's life.
Malory: And my money.
%
Those cannot be your only shoes.  What am I saying?  It's Russia.  People probably come from miles around just to get their picture taken in those.
%
Malory: Lana, you go straight to Moscow.
Lana: Undercover?
Malory: Of course undercover.
Lana: As what? Russia's only black woman?
%
Malory: Ray, get your purse and take some midol, you're going back for him.
Ray: According to these notes from my doctor, a radiologist and my new neurologist I am doing no such thing.
%
Archer: I thought they just wanted my hair so their scientists could unlock the secret of its luxurious fullness. Touch it, Barry.
Barry: No.
Archer: Come on.
Barry: It's not that thick back here.
%
He'll have an unexpected dinner guest, who, may be his son.  And for dessert, we will have the truth.  You hear that mother?  After lifetimes of your secrets and lies, we will finally have the truth!  Oh and hopefully shit loads of vodka.
%
Archer: Barry, wait, slow down!
Barry: Why?
Archer: So I can go past you!
%
So I can't stay for dinner.  I assume that smell is cabbage and not just you two.
%
Barry: Your boots are slipping.
Archer: Probably because there's 200 pounds of asshole hanging from them
Barry: 183!
Archer: Whatever, fat boy. Tell that to my silk socks.
Barry: Why are you wearing silk socks?
Archer: Is that a joke?
%
Barry: He sodomized my fiancee.
Malory: You're still together?
Barry: Oh I'm sorry, ex-fiance. That's what I meant to say.
Malory: Then it wasn't it meant to be.
%
Malory: And if that's my pantsuit you're stretching out I'll have your guts for garters.
Gillette: You NEED some garters.
%
Oh, rocket launchers.  My car is slowing down for no apparent reason.  Just must be out of... carburetor
%
Can you not rub your dick in my mother's pantyhose, please?
%
Gillette: He's like a thousand.
Lana: You won't be having sex with him.
Gillette: Well, wait, he is a Duke.
Lana: No means no.
%
I've broken into way tougher places, right?  Well, not without my turtleneck...
%
Archer: I have a plan that doesn't involve you stealing my toiletries.
Gillette: You're not using them.
Archer: Yes, I am
Gillette: Go look at your pores and then tell me you're using them
%
Why was he dressed as Hitler?
%
Why was I dressed like Hitler?
%
Gillette: Archer is drunk.
Malory: Who are you, Carrie Nation?
%
Gillette: How much?
Archer: It's hard to say.  $800,000?
Gillette: You lost 800 grand!?
Archer: No, remaining.
%
Gummi bears all around!  I'll eat hers if she doesn't have uhh teeth.
%
Benoit: Now if you excuse me, I must go find fresh towels and a whore.
Archer: Hey, Benoit, not to thick on either.
%
Lana: You turned archer loose with four million dollars in a casino?
Archer: Oh, don't worry. He may be vain, selfish liar and quite possibly alcoholic man whore, but gambling is one vice Sterling doesn't have.
Malory: Guess he's too busy doing all those other awesome stuff.  Thanks, mother.
%
Malory: I am not sharing a room with you.
Gillette: No, I'm sharing it with you and it's the last room in the hotel.  Mo view but it's got two queens.
Malory: Where's the other one, greasing up in the bathroom?
%
Wow, what a pussy. He was spilling the beans so fast, i could barely keep up.
%
Well, you did threaten to stick a knife up his dick hole.
%
Cyril: I was jacking it on the telephone.
Archer: Does Internet porn know you were cheating on it?
%
Archer: I'm not negotiating with a cyborg.
Lana: That's just a voice modulator.
Archer: You don't think cyborgs have that technology!?
%
Malory: Guess how many pygmies died cutting it down?  Hint: six.
%
Who taught you to punch, your husband?
%
I am literally wet with jealousy.
%
Archer: What's his name?
Cheryl: Babou, but it should be buyer's remorse.  Stupid thing's always sick.
%
And thanks Pam.  Way to drag out a kidnapping.  Now I'm late again. But this is a way better excuse than the train dwarf.  Yuck.
%
Cheryl: Mopeds are fun but you don't want to let your buddies see you riding one.
Pam: I thought he meant I was fuel efficient.  I had only had 10 ten beers.
Cheryl: 40s?
Pam: NO.... yes.
%
Pam: Zing! ... Wildly inappropriate.
Krieger: Seriously, Pam.
Pam: Okay, clone wars.
Krieger: Zing.
%
Cyril: Kriegers father's was a Nazi scientist.
Malory: And JFK's father was a bootlegger.
Cyril: What!? That's like comparing apples to Nazi oranges.
%
Archer: What have I been doing?
Lana: Chain smoking joints the size of tampons.
Archer: Eww.
Lana: Just a figure of speech.
Archer: Still, eww.
%
She's not gay, she just has big hands.
%
Well, first of all, you don't have to yell.  I don't have ear cancer.
%
Now shut up and kick in the door for me.  And do it bad ass like I would.  If I still had toe nails.
%
Archer: Lana, did you see my scarf?
Lana: Yes, Archer.  I saw your scarf.
Archer: All my hair fell out.
Lana: I'm sorry.
Archer: Me too.  It was my fifth best feature.
%
Gillette: My mother told me she loved me all the time.
Malory: Exactly, look how you turned out.
Gillette: Uh, with high self esteem?
%
I never thought I'd say this, but I really miss the Zima.
%
As you can see I have wine coolers on my feet because my toe nails are popping off like pogs.
%
Do I look like I need bald guy cream?.  Mikey, I can barely get a comb through this.  It's so thick my barber charges me double.
%
Hmm. Cock flavored spit?  Well you never know what's gonna be on the board!  Let me see cock-flavored spit!
%
Save it for the fast money round, Paddy.
%
Hostage: Do you have any have any idea who our boss is?
Archer: Nope, but 100 people surveyed.  Number one answer's on the board. Name the douchebag who's in charge.
Hostage: Vincent van Gogh fuck yourself.
Archer: Hmm? Vincent van Gogh fuck myself?  Survey says?
%
Plus I can only assume a Brazilian mafia would be about a gazillion times hotter.
%
Archer: Cry "Havoc!" and let slip the hogs of war.
Krieger: Dogs of wars.
Archer: Whatever farm animal of war, Lana.  Shut up.
%
Archer: I've been treating my cancer with sugar pills!?
Krieger: You didn't think it was weird your chemo drugs were chewable?
Archer: Little kids get cancer.
%
Archer: Hello? There's this great new thing called coasters!
Cheryl: Geesh Al, sorry.
Archer: Don't apologize to me, apologize to the Brazilian Rosewood.
%
Archer: Lana, I'm in love with you.
Lana: You are also shitfaced.
Archer: I can be both.
%
Trinet: You can't tattoo a baby!
Archer: That's what the tattoo guy said. I had to slip him an extra hundred bucks!
%
Archer: I wanted to spend some time with the Wee Baby Seamus.
Trinet: He's not even your real kid.
Archer: So?
Trinet: So it's weird.
Archer: So is me paying you child support, Trinet, but you keep cashing the checks.
Trinet: Hey!
Archer: I'm sorry.  Come on Trinet, Seamus may not be my real son.  But he's probably the closest I'm ever gonna get.
Trinet: Where are you taking him?
Archer: I dunno, what's he into?
%
Rita: Well if it isn't Chet Manley.
Archer: And it's I want to say.. Peggy?
Rita: Rita.  And you said you'd call me.
Archer: Really?  To both statements...?
%
Doctor: Any history of alcoholism?
Archer [drinking]: You know, I drink socially.
Malory [also drinking]: Hah! What?  I didn't have breakfast...
%
Krieger: My entire laboratory is at your disposal.
Malory: thanks I'll let you know if I need a hybrid pig-boy.
%
Malory: Especially Sterling.  If he found out i might have breast cancer, he'd be devastated.  This information cannot leave this... Pam what the hell?
Pam: What? Nothing.
Malory: You're texting about my...
Pam: I'm not I swear, this is about...
Cheryl: Breast caner! Oh, you poor thing.
Malory: Pam!
Pam: what?
Malory: What is wrong with you?
Pam: I can't help it.  It's like a disease.
Malory: Pam!
Pam: Do you not know what disease means?  Oh sorry I forgot you might have...
Cyril: Breast cancer!
%
Malory: I had a mammogram on Friday and they found something.
Pam: So is that why you're being such a bitch?
%
Cheryl: Do anything fun this weekend?  Because I sure did.  Friday night was cornhole league and then on Saturday...
Malory: If I cared what you do on the weekend I'd stick a shotgun in my mouth and pull the trigger with my toes.
Cheryl: Saturday I watched a building burn down.
%
Lana: Oh My... You're getting off on this!
Archer: And?
%
Cheryl: You're not my supervisor!
Pam: Shut up! We're going to go to prison.
Cheryl: No, we're not.  Say the right stuff and they just send you to a mental hospital for ten months.
Gilette: I just this second realize why you do macrame instead of knitting.
Cheryl: Yeah, no sharp weapons on the ward.  They were really strict about that.
%
Archer: I would have qualified... if I made it to the thing.
Lana: If your aunt has balls, she'd be your uncle.
%
Here's a sniper out there whose bullet could spark World War III and you idiots are tying up ISIS resources on high school bullshit?  Cause I don't really see a downside to that Archer-wise.  So load up.  There should be a big box of grenades around here somewhere.
%
That so hard?  Count Snackula.
%
Malory: So make her 40.
Cyril: And who's going to play her?
Malory: Me!  That's the whole point.
Cyril: You do realize there's a finite amount of Vaseline in the world?
%
Malory: I think I can sell them on a rewrite, if you fix it.
Cyril: For starters, I don't think you wanna say this guy is as coal black and thick-muscled as a fieldhand.
Malory: I don't need you for content, just for plot structure.
Cyril: Racist overtones aside, it really kinda limits your casting options. I mean, only two, three guys could play that.
%
You can't have a flasback with a flashforward in it.  That's just bad writing.
%
Cheryl: Deaf people are gross.
Pam: Not as gross as the hook hand ones.
Cheryl: Eh? I dunno.
%
Rona: Where's my journal?
Pam: I maybe kind of sort of took it?
Gillette: Why would you do that?
Cheryl: Did you think it was meat?
%
Archer: Your stance.  You're fighting yourself.
Rona: Excuse me?
Archer: You're all rigid and stiff.  Which I'm all for.  Rim shot.
%
Oh my god, if I possessed the capacity to be embarrassed.
%
Archer: You're just doing this to spite me!
Lana: And?
%
Archer: I am qualified because I happen to be the world's greatest secret agent.
Rona: But you're a man.
Archer: And then some.
%
Lana: This isn't the Sheriff's department where you get wear a windbreak and go on a ride-along.  This is highly classified cover ops.
Rona: Yes!  Covert ops!  This is exactly the kind of spy lingo I want to soak up.
Pam: What part of highly classified do you not understand?
Rona: All of it!
%
Archer: Judging from the decor, I'm guessing Spelvin has one of those kick ass Japanese soaking tubs.
Cyril: After all that you want to take a bath?
Archer: Do you not?
%
Cyril: I have one bullet left.
George Spelvin: He does?
Archer: Who am I? Count Bulletsula?  Like Dracula.  That was bad.  Come back to me. I can do better.
%
Shoot him Cyril!  But just him.  I think the twins are warming up to me.  Right?  Am I getting some signals?
%
Archer: Dammit Cyril you said they were sexy.
Cyril: Ninjas are sexy.
George Spelvin: Right?
Cyril: Well I think so!
%
Archer: Take the suits to my tailor and the shoes to my shoemaker.
Cyril: You have a shoemaker?
Archer: Do you not?
%
Cyril: I happen to be a kick ass accountant!
George Spelvin: Did that sound a lot better in your head?
Cyril: Yes it did.
%
Pam: It could take hours for this to bypass the electronic lock.
Archer: Then I should definitely get my turtleneck.
%
Cyril: Archer, do something!
Archer: Who am I, Alan Turing?  He was also in X-Men, remember?
%
Pam: How's the elevator supposed to work with a gillion pounds of computers on it?!
Cheryl: Who am I, Elisha Otis?
%
Cyril: Maybe I could kill that pesky old worm?
Pam: How you gonna do that?  Disappoint it to death?
%
What is this thing, made of Wolverine's bones?  Does no one here read X-Men?
%
Pam: The identity of every single ISIS field agent is on there!
Archer: So what?
Malory: Because most secret agents don't tell every harlot from here to Hanoi that they ARE secret agents.
Archer: Then why be one?
%
Archer: Pam, wait up!  Get me drunk enough and i might have sex with you
Pam: Really?
Archer: No.  It's a catch-22.   The amount of alcohol I would need would literally kill me.  But I do want to see how many pool balls you can stick in your mouth.
Pam: My record's three.
%
What! Whaaaat!
%
Woodhouse: 1,200 pounds
Archer: No one is getting killed over however much that is in real money.
%
Did you see that?  That was like like Steve McQueen and John Woo had a baby and that baby was you, baby.
%
Archer: You want me to take a baby to a murder?
Malory: Wherever, just out of here. I have no more love to give today.
Archer: What is it, like 2:30?
%
Pam: Can you explain compounding interest to Cheryl?
Cyril: Maybe if we had an infinite amount of time and she was some one else
%
I can do baby or I can do geezer murder mystery but I can't do both!
%
Archer: Cannot picture you as a fighter pilot.
Woodhouse: Oh no, sir.  Not a pilot - a batman.  An officer's personal attendant, in charge of keeping his kit in good order, seeing to his personal needs.
Archer: So a servant.
Woodhouse: Solider servant was the official term.
Archer: Yeah, way to advance.
%
Woodhouse:  One by one, the last surviving member of the double duece are being... murdered.
Archer: Oh my god....  are we out of Bloody Marys?
%
Archer: You realize you're in huge trouble.
Woodhouse: Yes, sir.
Archer: And now I have to spend my first Friday off in like forever...
Woodhouse: Yes, sir.
Archer: ...devising some bizarre punishment for you.
Woodhouse: Yes, sir.
Archer: So don't be suprised if you find yourself eating a whole bunch of spiderwebs.
%
[If I brought food] I wouldn't have room for beer, and since I can't catch beer....
%
She gets dinner in Dixieland and laid.  And I get mosquitoes and no beer and not laid.  How could this get any...  [alligator murmurs] LET ME FINISH... worse.  You ruined it.  You ruined the moment.
%
Gandalf: I love your new hairdo, by the way.
Lana: Well if you like the collar, you're gonna love the cuffs.
%
Krieger: Pam, if you're dumping stuff on the street, you can also dump these.
Pam: What is it?
Krieger: Shattered dreams.
Cheryl: Smells like rotten meat.
Krieger: Also, yes.
%
Lana: What's your third biggest fear?
Archer: Brain aneurysm.
Lana: What's a brain aneurysm have to do with walking around in a swamp?
Archer: Nothing, it can happen anywhere at anytime, that's what makes it so terrifying.
%
Lana: What are your three biggest fears?
Archer: Getting stuck on a boat with you three times.
%
Lana [opens cooler of nothing but beer]: You're shitting me.
Archer: I know.  A rainbow should shoot out every time you open it.
%
We all have to chip in to make ISIS green. Look at me chopping ice for a Tom Collins like a field hand... or do I want a mint julep?
%
Try clearing your throat about a gillion more times and see if that helps.
%
Archer: This must be what it's like to have sex with me.
Lana: How could an airboat be selfish?
%
Archer [to airboat owner]: I've waited my entire life to say this exact phrase, "I'm commandeering this airboat!"
Lana: Sorry, it really is an emergency.
Archer: Of an awesome and ass-kicking nature!
%
Lana: He's attacked nuclear power plants, hydroelectric dams, and whaling ships.
Archer: Whaling ships? What he's got something against clean burning lamp oil?
%
His name's Gandalf and he's not a hippie?
%
Flight Attendant: Sir, can you please find your seat?
Archer: Uh yeah, it's right there.  Can you go find some more hurricanes for me?
%
Lana: Is that a friggin' candy bar?
Archer: Yeah, but do you think you need the calories?
%
Malory: Why are you drinking?
Archer: It's a party.
Malory: It's a baby shower! For the bastard child you pumped into a filthy whore!
Archer: I'm obviously not saying now, but one of these days you're make the best grandmother ever.
%
Krieger: So, uh have you ever thought about having a baby?
Cheryl: Sometimes I think about adopting a little baby so I could abandon it at a mall.
Krieger: That answers my follow up question.
%
The mochachino ones are the cutest.  And I guess he'd be half gay too.  Can you say, "best dancer ever!?"
%
Lana: Did you see me holding that baby?
Gillette: Look liked Tyson holding that dove.
%
Give her the rabbit, Lenny!
%
That's disgusting.  If I wanted to look at your bare feet, Woodhouse, I'd sneak in and do it while you're asleep.
%
Because I told you to buy lemon curd, Woodhouse.  Now what am I going to spread on my toast?  Your tears?
%
Trinette: Wait a minute.  You liar, this isn't a condom wrapper!  It's from a friggin' candy bar.
Archer: So? Sometimes I like to treat myself.
Trinette: Well, sometimes I like ovulate.
Archer: Well, I have to sleep, so do it somewhere else.
%
Trinette: I'm retired.
Archer: Yeah, your 401(k) doing that well?
Trinette: I have a SEP, smart ass.
%
Cyril: Ever since Lana and I broke up, I take solace in food.
Archer: Well keep your chins up, all eleven of them.
%
What do you even do here?  Sit on your ass and analyze data?  Well I'm a field agent, Isaac Newton. I risk my life.  So yeah, I do deserve the best space in the parking garage.  Like it would kill you to roll fifty feet?  The stupid thing's electric.
%
Malory: Sterling!  Len!  Either and or both? Where the hell are you? Len?
Barry: Do you know where he is?
Malory: Yes, I'm just screaming his name down the hall to celebrate that fact.
%
Cheryl: So, Krieger's a doctor.
Cyril: Not the medical kind!
Krieger: Not even the other kind... technically.
%
Archer: Why do we have so many damn dolls in here?
Pam: For sexual harassment complaints so people can non-verbally indicate where stuff happened on their bodies.
Archer: That takes like one doll.
Pam: Not if there's ever a gang rape.  (fingers crossed)
%
Archer: Can you put it in a person's brain?
Krieger: It'd suffocate.
Archer: Not the rabbit, you idiot - the chip.
Krieger: Oh yes, absolutely.
Archer: Without killing the person?
Krieger: Oh... maybe?
%
Barry: Don't try anything stupid.
Archer: I don't have to try....  shit, whatever, move.
%
Just try to think about something else like there's no sink in there.
%
Cheryl: You can't control a person's heart.
Krieger: You can with a little something I like to call a deep cycle marine battery... or LSD.
%
Ouch, my earballs.
%
My plan is to crowd source a plan.
%
Barry: Yours for the taking, if you are similarly mine for the taking
Lana: "Taking" as in to get this job I have to have sex with you?
Barry: Hey, those are your words.  And also mine, yes.
%
Cheryl: Why don't you go back to Jamaica?
Pam: A) Because I got deported.
%
Archer: You've been lying to me my entire life.  Just for once I want you to tell me the truth.
Malory: Well, people in hell want ice water.
%
Malory: And what? You think he wanted to mind control you into loving him?
Archer: You tell me, mother.  That's your speciality!
%
Anka: My hands are really burning.
Archer: Woh. That's first degree frost bite.  Too bad you don't have big mitteny gloves like me.  I can't feel a thing in them.
%
Anka: Are you going to throw that in my face the rest of my life?
Archer: Yeah, all four minutes of it.
%
Immigrants.  Cramming their low riders full of free health care and... snow.
%
I'm sure I've been in worse situations... but right now I'm kind of drawing a blank.
%
I can't be alone.  That's when she strikes like a slutty little Ninja.
%
Archer: I forgot you won the Olympic gold medal in men's downhill.
Gillette: Well, ass, it was giant shalom and I only took bronze.
Archer: So? You lost?
Gillette: I came in third.
Archer: Which is last.
Gillette: Which is third...
Archer: Last.
Gillette: In he world.
Archer: You lost.  Geeze, get over it.
%
So does this look as bad as it looks?
%
Anka: I'm from Germany, where the age of consent is 14.
Archer:  What is it, the Alabama of Europe?
%
Archer: She doesn't look like she's just turning 17.
Lana: No, she looks like she's just turning 18.
Archer: Exactly. Plus Europeans use the metric system...
%
Lana: Gestad? Count me in!
Archer: And me out.  I'm not getting frost bite protecting some old German guy.
Malory: Herr Schlotz isn't the intended victim.  It's his daughter Anka.
Archer: Who obviously needs someone on her.  Constantly.  I will that someone who's constantly on her.
%
Cyril: I will start cooking the books.
Lana: Good thing you know how to cheat.
%
Videotex?  Wow, growth industry.
%
Krenshaw: Jesus, Archer, you think this is a game?
Archer: No, I think Jenga's a game.
%
Malory: This is why I can't have nice things
Archer: Why, because you shoot them?
%
ISIS Agent: No.
Pam: Yes!
ISIS Agent: No.
Pam: Have sex with me!
ISIS Agent: No.
Pam: Please?
ISIS Agent: No!
Pam: Gesturing with the dolphin hand-puppet towards his crotch
Aww, come on..
ISIS Agent: Pam...
Pam: Still in the dolphin voice
Nobody will ever know....
ISIS Agent: Yeah... I'd know.
%
(Lana's voice is heard on Intercom)
Lana: Hi, if any of you men want to have sex with me (Cyril gasps) Come to my office and take a number.
(A large crowd of men appear before Lana's office. With Pam shoving her way thru.)
Pam: You heard the lady! (holds up piece of paper with number one on it)  Take a number!!
%
Archer: I'm hungry.
Malory: So lick that coat.  You smell like a...
Archer: Grill cheese.
Malory: What?
Archer: Grill me a cheese.
Malory: I'm not grilling you a cheese!
Archer: (Begins sobbing)
%
What! Who's there!? What do you want!? Because all your gonna get is holes...Uh.. I mean... holes in you... not my holes...
%
Lana: (to Cyril) Seriously, you cheated on me with Carol!?
(Mentioned girl passes by open door)
Cheryl: It's Cheryl!
Lana: (to Cyril) Exactly, I think I made my point.
%
(Trying to figure out who Archers father is)
Archer: And just who might my dad be?
Malory: Gene Krupa, no wait... not Krupa... the other one, the one with Teeth......Buddy Rich.
Archer: (shocked) What?
Malory: I could never say no to a drummer.
Archer: (furious) COULD YOU SAY NO TO ANYONE!!?
(Malory vicously slaps him across face and glares)
Malory: (glowering) I said no to plenty.
%
Sterling Archer: ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND? (throws glass tumbler into decanter)
Malory Archer: I must be, because it looks like you just destroyed my Steuben bar set.
Sterling Archer: Well you just destroyed my innocence!
Malory Archer: Oh Please! That Brazilian au pair did that when you were thirteen.
Sterling Archer: Twelve.
%
(To himself) Barry, does this make up for Framboise?  It does other Barry, it sure does.
%
Malory: (discussing Arhcer) He'll be back! Crying for his mommy, just like that christmas break when I moved and forgot to give the boarding school my new address. (Carol who's listening gasps) I mean he rode the train all the way into town he couldn't pick up a phone book!? (Carol gasps horrified) 9 years old and crying for his mommy in that Police Station like a little girl! What does that tell you?
Carol: (disgusted) Kind of a lot actually....
Malory: (annoyed) Oh shut up I bet your barren.
%
(Malory is Depressed because she thinks Sterling's Dead)
Malory: (Despondent) Bring me some posion Pam because I don't wish to live anymore! I'm dead inside...
Pam: (holding notice) Too, dead inside to read good news?
Malory: (overly dramatic) Is it my Obituary?
Pam: (smirking) Well, it's not that much good news.
Malory: (snarling) GIVE ME THAT, OAF!!
(looks at paper) OH MY GOD! Sterling! He's Alive!!
%
Carol: So after I..(dodges a thrown Vase) after I call your vase guy?
Malory: (refering to Archer) Freeze everyone of his accounts!! And then call woodhouse, then we'll see how long Sterling can go without suckling at my teat!
Carol: (shudder) Ugh!
%
(Barry walks into the Office thinking Lana killed Archer)
Lana: (offscreen) Barry, you might want to call the cleaners.
Barry: Wha...?
(We hear something smash)
Lana: (looks down at unconscious Barry) Because there is lamp everywhere.
%
(While chasing a rouge agent)
Archer: O.D.I.N. doesn't beat Sterling Archer, only Archer beats...
(The car stops in the Town Square, the Agent nowhere in sight)
Lana: Didja, wanna finish that thought?
Archer: Didja, wanna shut your negative (sturggles to think of insult) bad wordsy mouth!?
%
(Kreiger is choking Carol/Cheryl with his robotic hand)
Carol/Cheryl: (strangled) Kreiger! Grrgh Doopp!! Goont Dooop!
(Kreiger turn off the arm, Carol/Cheryl pants and gasps)
Kreiger: OH GOD! I am so sorry I didn't realize...
Carol/Cheryl: (annoyed) What are you doing? I said "Don't stop!"
%
(Carol to Cyril, who has his hand pinned to Pam's mouth)
Carol: (suspicous) What are you doing?
Cyril: (lying) Just trying to get my muffin back!
Carol: Uh, not like that your not (growls) You gotta slug her in the stomach, with a forarm shiver.
(Cyril looks at Pam, who gives him a pleading look)

Carol: (naked except for mop covering her) Ohhh, pamela you read me like a poem...

Carol: (shrugs) I don't know, "World's Gushiest Orgasm?"

Lana: Cyril is already freaked out enough about us sharing this shoebox without you air-drying your unkempt bush.
Archer: Unkempt bush!? You're one to talk.
Lana: (goes to answer door) My vulva is a smoother than a veal cutlet!
(Opens door in her underwear to reveal Cyril in Steward outfit) Crappy timing...

(Lana's going away on a mission)
Cyril: Isnt it sudden you going on this mission?
Lana: Noooo....Sudden is wanting your girlfriend to move in with you after only 4 months.
Cyril: (defensive) Just talking about it...and by the way I moved in with my last girlfriend after only 4 weeks.
Lana: (stopping next to Malory, Sterling, Carol and Pam) What are you a lesbian?
Pam: Why would you be into that? (group plus Cyril and Lana turn to stare) Just curious, which was an odd word choice right there and am I talking out loud..
%
Sterling: (Looking into Lana's eyes) No they're, oh my god they're green, like emeralds. How did I never see that? Lana, your eyes are amazing.
Lana: (Sighs, leans in to kiss) Archer.
Sterling: I mean, not compared to your tits but.
(Lana shoots Sterling in the foot)
%
(Cyril wonders why Lana hasn't called him yet)
Archer: (serious) Worse case scenario: Her covers been blown and Skorpio is now rapeing her sensless (everyone gasps horrified) before chopping her mangled corpse into Fish Chum.
Cyril: (hyperventilating) Oh my god!!
Carol: (appalled) How could you say that!?
Pam: What is wrong with you!!?

Malory: HA! Seriously thou, you should look thru some of her design catalogue's.
%
Archer: Ha ha ha, Ramon.
Ramon: And just why is that so funny.
Archer: Not that. Woodhouse, he's all tied up somewhere. Scared and alone. Ha ha ha, probably dehydrated.
%
No no no no, like a big sweaty fireman carries you out of a burning building, lays you on the sidewalk and you think, yeah, ok he's going to give me mouth to mouth. Instead, he just starts choking the shit out of you, and the last sensation you feel before you die, is that he's squeezing your throat so hard that a big wet blob of drool drips off his teeth and just, plurp, falls right onto your popped out eye ball.
%
So you just listen to me, Mr Man. Get me some video footage of hot man on man action by tonight, or don't bother coming home!

Rudi: I'm gonna dress you up like a little gnome and just have you live in my garden.
Woodhouse: I would like some new clothes.
%
Oh my god, you like, sneeze glitter!

Archer: Do you not see me rocking this chiseled slab of hard man body? I mean come on. Are you gay or not?
Ramon: I am, but you... you are so not my type.
Archer: Hey! I am everybody's type!
%
Is this some sort of viral marketing? Or are you asking me specifically if I have a penis?
%
Because how hard is it to poach a god damn egg properly? Seriously, that's like eggs 101 Woodhouse.
%
Archer: Woah woah woah, I thought nobody else was supposed to know about this.
Malory: He won't remember.
Krieger: Yeah, no... I'm... I am shitfaced.

Archer: You know, when I was little I used to pretend you weren't my mother.
Malory: Me too.

Woodhouse: I'm afraid the lemur got into the pudding cups.
Archer: Yeah, like I told you he would, you idiot.
%
Malory: Jesus, God, Sterling... School girls?!
Archer: Those are just costumes.
Malory: And I suppose that makes it better?
Archer: Doesn't it?

Malory: (to Sterling) Keep that tramp date of yours out of my Medicine-Cabnit! One more dead body in here and that Bitch Trudy Beekman will have me right back in front of the Co-op Board!
Sterling: (shakes head) You just can't get along with your neighbours anywhere can you?
Malory: Who can get along with a woman who wallpapers her guest bathroom with Vintage New Yorker covers?!
%
Malory: But they were blanks, weren't they?
Archer: Uhhh, only if the back of his skull picked that exact moment to explode outwards.
%
Archer: Woodhouse! What are you doing?
Woodhouse: Uh, sitting down sir.
Archer: What, at the table? Like people?

Lana: I find your lack of faith disturbing.

Pam: I find them kind of sexy.

Caterer: Gravlax?
Lana: Thanks, no. I'm allergic to cat piss.

Malory: I said no such thing.
Archer: Well, your mouth did.
Malory: Well, your mouth better get over there and make Torvald happy.
Archer: Um, phrasing.

Archer: What is that smell?
Malory: Gravlax and failure. I think Lana just Broke Torvald's Hand.
Archer: Truckasaurus.
%
Archer: So let me guess..
Lana: Yeah, who ever he is, he ghosted an ID file onto our world wide data base.
Archer: Yeah, which you probably found while researching me-
Lana: [Sigh]
Archer: Lana, 'cause you're in the ah... Danger Zone!
%
You know what's dangerous? You're obsession with me. Seriously, Lana, call Kenny Loggins, 'cause you're in the Danger Zone.
%
Lana: I think Conway is totally up to something.
Archer: Duh! You think I'm an idiot? I know he wants to marry mother and have her cut me out of the will. Which is why I'm going to kill him.
%
Conway: I've tracked him to South Beach where he's arranged to sell the plans to Cuban Naval Intelligence. If that happens, undetectable Cuban missile subs can be parked right off Miami beach.
Malory: Ugh. Just what Miami needs, more Cubans.
%
Lana: A non-circumcised Jewish guy, that's not weird to you?
Archer: No. Why would... I mean, I'm not Jewish, and I am circumcised so it can happen the other-
Lana: It doesn't work like that.
Archer: Lana come on. I think we both know it works fine.
Lana: Aw, come on! Not your dick, dumb ass!

Archer: See that! He was putting on his pants and I stopped him. So you just watch your step Mr.... damn it.
Conway: Hey right there, what you should have gone with, was Sammy Gayvis Jr.

Malory: We need a diversity hire.
Archer: I vote Asian chick!

Lana: (sarcastic) Imagine that!!
Archer: You imagine it!
Malory: BOTH OF YOU IMAGINE SHUTTING UP!!!

Cyril: Hey, will I get to learn Karate?

Cheryl: Beep beep beep.
Pam: Oh, your giving me the truck noise, Karen Carpenter stunt double?

Receptionist: Swear to god Mr. Archer, I have H. R. on speed dial.

Archer: Stop. Shut up. I have to go, and If I find one single dog hair when I get back, I'll... rub sand in your dead little eyes.
Woodhouse: Very good, Sir.
Archer: I also need you to go buy sand.
Woodhouse: Yes, Sir.
Archer: I don't know if they grade it, but... coarse.

Malory: Agent Performance: unsatisfactory.
Archer: Aw, com 'on. At worst that was "needs improvement."

KGB (Crenshaw): This may be old cliche, but... we have ways of making you talk.
