Do I look like I need bald guy cream?.  Mikey, I can barely get a comb through this.  It's so thick my barber charges me double.

Hmm. Cock flavored spit?  Well you never know what's gonna be on the board!  Let me see cock-flavored spit!

Save it for the fast money round, Paddy.

Hostage: Do you have any have any idea who our boss is?
Archer: Nope, but 100 people surveyed.  Number one answer's on the board. Name the douchebag who's in charge.
Hostage: Vincent van Gogh fuck yourself.
Archer: Hmm? Vincent van Gogh fuck myself?  Survey says?

Plus I can only assume a Brazilian mafia would be about a gazillion times hotter.

Archer: I've been treating my cancer with sugar pills!?

Archer: I wanted to spend some time with the Wee Baby Seamus.
Trinet: He's not even your real kid.
Archer: So?
Trinet: So it's weird.
Archer: So is me paying you child support, Trinet, but you keep cashing the checks.
Trinet: Hey!
Archer: I'm sorry.  Come on Trinet, Seamus may not be my real son.  But he's probably the closest I'm ever gonna get.
Trinet: Where are you taking him?
Archer: I dunno, what's he into?

Cyril: You said you wanted watermelon.
Cheryl: Watermelon's red?
Cyril: Yes. How do you not know that?
Cheryl: Who am I? Charles Frederick Andress?

Cyril: Why are you so scared of crocodiles?
Archer: Gee, I don't know, Cyril. Maybe deep down I'm afraid of any apex predator that lived through the K-T extinction. Physically unchanged for a hundred million years, because it's the perfect killing machine. A half ton of cold-blooded fury, the bite force of 20,000 Newtons, and stomach acid so strong it can dissolve bones and hoofs.

People who like you because you have cocaine aren't people you want as friends, Pam!  And not to sound elitist, but neither are people who need a roll of quarters to take a shower!
%
We're talking about Texas. Somebody somewhere wants enough cocaine to forget they live there.

That's gotta be a real knee to the old emotional nut sack.

Are we seriously done with "phrasing?" I mean, not right there necessarily, although "tongue" and "gaping hole" were kinda begging for it.
%
I always worried I would die without knowing how it felt to get my throat slashed and my tongue yanked out through the gaping hole.
%
What's that? I can't hear you over the sound of I have snake poisoning.
%
Ray: We blew up an oil pipeline.
Cyril: Not to mention a bunch of...people.  Compared to that, this is kind of a victimless crime. If it even is a crime. I mean, is it?
Archer:...he said, sucking at being a lawyer.
%
It's not like we're selling cocaine to little kids!
%
Ray: Intel? No, do not compare what we do now to intelligence work.
Archer: Don't worry, I won't. Because selling cocaine to cocaine dealers doesn't really compare to helping overthrow democratic governments, like the US did in Guatemala, Chile, Nicaragua, oh! Iran?! Because, spoiler alert, those didn't really work out so great. But that's okay, because I'm pinning my hopes for the future on the next big shipment of stinger missiles to that rag tag bunch of Mujahidin heroes in Afghanistan!
%
So if you'll hide your vaginas, it's time to gather some intel.

Oh, and just so you know, that's exactly how Len Koenecke died.

Malory: Well, sure, now. Wait until you're waist deep in diapers, he's up with the croup and there's no bourbon in the house. Then fast forward to him knocking up the au pair, flunking out of college, and then single-handedly bankrupting your drug cartel!

I'm sorry, Lana. I said a woman. Not a stevedore who lost his hand in a stevedoring accident and then got a hand transplant from an actual bear!

I couldn't hear you over the sound of this gigantic freakin' tank!

I can do baby or I can do geezer murder mystery but I can't do both!

Woodhouse: Oh no, sir.  Not a pilot - a batman.  An officer's personal attendant, in charge of keeping his kit in good order, seeing to his personal needs.

That's disgusting.  If I wanted to look at your bare feet, Woodhouse, I'd sneak in and do it while you're asleep.

You know what's dangerous? You're obsession with me. Seriously, Lana, call Kenny Loggins, 'cause you're in the Danger Zone.

Lana: I think Conway is totally up to something.
Archer: Duh! You think I'm an idiot? I know he wants to marry mother and have her cut me out of the will. Which is why I'm going to kill him.

Conway: I've tracked him to South Beach where he's arranged to sell the plans to Cuban Naval Intelligence. If that happens, undetectable Cuban missile subs can be parked right off Miami beach.
Malory: Ugh. Just what Miami needs, more Cubans.
%
Lana: A non-circumcised Jewish guy, that's not weird to you?

Lana: Aw, come on! Not your dick, dumb ass!

Cyril: You said you wanted watermelon.
Cheryl: Watermelon's red?
Cyril: Yes. How do you not know that?
Cheryl: Who am I? Charles Frederick Andress?

Cyril: Why are you so scared of crocodiles?
Archer: Gee, I don't know, Cyril. Maybe deep down I'm afraid of any apex predator that lived through the K-T extinction. Physically unchanged for a hundred million years, because it's the perfect killing machine. A half ton of cold-blooded fury, the bite force of 20,000 Newtons, and stomach acid so strong it can dissolve bones and hoofs.

Gillette: How much?
Archer: It's hard to say.  $800,000?
Gillette: You lost 800 grand!?

Benoit: Now if you excuse me, I must go find fresh towels and a whore.
Archer: Hey, Benoit, not to thick on either.

Lana: You turned archer loose with four million dollars in a casino?

Malory: I am not sharing a room with you.
Gillette: No, I'm sharing it with you and it's the last room in the hotel.  Mo view but it's got two queens.
Malory: Where's the other one, greasing up in the bathroom?

Wow, what a pussy. He was spilling the beans so fast, i could barely keep up.

Well, you did threaten to stick a knife up his dick hole.

Cyril: I was jacking it on the telephone.
Archer: Does Internet porn know you were cheating on it?

Archer: I'm not negotiating with a cyborg.

Closet rampage!

Archer: You realize that's like every fairytale.
%
Seriously, what is this, the Shire?
%
Lana: Just curious, what happened between your bedroom and right now?
Archer: Well, you were hysterical, Lana, so I thought the best thing to do would be inject you with a tranquilizer, drive you to a private air field, put you on a CIA plane, fly you overnight to Wales, and then...that brings us to now.

Pam: How do you not murder her every day?
Krieger: I do!
%
Yeah, a little baby girl, Abijean. With Lana. And then we started going out again, and it's kind of amazing, really. We're like, connecting, you know, and I realized that all this time, even though we fought like cats and a very tall dog, we've always been best friends.  And then to realize that you might actually be in love with your best friend, who also happens to be the mother of your child, that's like a miracle.

Malory: Pam!

Malory: I had a mammogram on Friday and they found something.

Lana: Oh My... You're getting off on this!
Archer: And?
%
Cheryl: You're not my supervisor!
Pam: Shut up! We're going to go to prison.
Cheryl: No, we're not.  Say the right stuff and they just send you to a mental hospital for ten months.
Gilette: I just this second realize why you do macrame instead of knitting.

Here's a sniper out there whose bullet could spark World War III and you idiots are tying up ISIS resources on high school bullshit?  Cause I don't really see a downside to that Archer-wise.  So load up.  There should be a big box of grenades around here somewhere.

That so hard?  Count Snackula.

I decided to let Ray drive. With his racist robot monster hand!

Lana: Well, I did get an A in college biology.
Dr. Sklodowska: Oh,wow, great. So when we're traversing the occipital lobe, you'll know what to do if the ship is in imminent danger of phagocytosis by polymorphonuclear leukocytes?
Lana: It actually might have been an A minus.

Ray: Oh! So I'm good enough to drive y'all around?! Great! Maybe on the way we can stop off down the Piggly Wiggly!

The information you're about to hear is top secret. Unauthorized publication or leaking of this information would be an act of high treason, for which you would tried and convicted by a secret military tribunal and summarily executed. So no, Ms Poovey, I don't think a selfie would be appropriate.

I am totally digging this whole Queen Kong vibe.

Now's the perfect time. It's not like you haven't thought about it. Just crash the sub and kill them, Cyril.

Slater: So, I saw you coming on to Archer.

Lana: Oh, so suddenly you don't have a death wish!

Cheryl: Who am I? Charles Frederick Andress?

Cyril: Why are you so scared of crocodiles?
Archer: Gee, I don't know, Cyril. Maybe deep down I'm afraid of any apex predator that lived through the K-T extinction. Physically unchanged for a hundred million years, because it's the perfect killing machine. A half ton of cold-blooded fury, the bite force of 20,000 Newtons, and stomach acid so strong it can dissolve bones and hoofs.

Your version didn't have coveralls.

Archer: You have a potato?
Malory: What is this? Christmas?

Archer: Gee, I don't know, Cyril. Maybe deep down I'm afraid of any apex predator that lived through the K-T extinction. Physically unchanged for a hundred million years, because it's the perfect killing machine. A half ton of cold-blooded fury, the bite force of 20,000 Newtons, and stomach acid so strong it can dissolve bones and hoofs.

Do you like to travel?  Because if you don't find that bag, I will empty the entire contents of your body and use your leathery skin as a replacement.
%
On your knees, hands behind your head, and toss out that weapon!  But not in that order.
%
Archer: You swallowed a pool ball?
Pam: I wish just one and I still got two to go.
%
Archer: I don't need a doctor, Katya doesn't have VD!
Malory: You haven't had sex with her?
%
How is this happy play time? Use your imagines, make a soccer ball out of a dead cat.
%
Barry: Come on, it's your son's life.
Malory: And my money.
%
Those cannot be your only shoes.  What am I saying?  It's Russia.  People probably come from miles around just to get their picture taken in those.
%
Malory: Lana, you go straight to Moscow.
Lana: Undercover?
Malory: Of course undercover.
Lana: As what? Russia's only black woman?
%
Malory: Ray, get your purse and take some midol, you're going back for him.
Ray: According to these notes from my doctor, a radiologist and my new neurologist I am doing no such thing.
%
Archer: I thought they just wanted my hair so their scientists could unlock the secret of its luxurious fullness. Touch it, Barry.
Barry: No.
Archer: Come on.
Barry: It's not that thick back here.
%
He'll have an unexpected dinner guest, who, may be his son.  And for dessert, we will have the truth.  You hear that mother?  After lifetimes of your secrets and lies, we will finally have the truth!  Oh and hopefully shit loads of vodka.
%
Archer: Barry, wait, slow down!
Barry: Why?
Archer: So I can go past you!
%

Archer: Where's Lana?
Krieger: I'm not even 100% sure where I am right now. (gets shot with a tranquilizer for the 3rd time by Archer)
Archer: (to tranquilizer gun) You are my new favorite thing
%
Pam: Pardon, but I'm supposed to-- (Queen slaps Pam)
Queen: Woman! I will kill you where you stand!
Cheryl: Which by law, I would be required to tell you if there was a murder in the house (pause) Ohhh, but if you're the murderer....That's what I love about this job. You learn something new every day.
%
Queen: Foolish woman! Where is the bathroom!?
Cheryl: Where isn't the bathroom? Am I right?
%
Why are your plans always so complicated? You're like Wyle E Coyote with access to predator drones.
%
Lana: And just so we're clear, he's the Prince of Duhan, an allied country.
Slater: Yeah, I'm gonna refer you back to "Because I said so."
%
Lana: First of all, your plan was too complicated!
Slater: Maybe for you people.
Archer: It had everything except a sign for free birdseed.
%
Slater: Everyone else, these are your dossiers. Read them on the way to Tunt Manor.
Cheryl: Tunt Manor! That's my house!
Slater: I know! (mimicking Cheryl's high voice) And because you know the property, you'll be posing as the listing agent.
Cheryl: Ahhhh! (squealing and clapping)
Mallory: Shut up!
Cheryl: Burn!
%
I am pushing. Swearzy realzies
%
Lem Kane: That's why I had to keep my secret. Can you imagine what that would mean to big oil or OPEC?
Archer: Well, there's no need to be racist.
Lana: How is the acronym for the organization of pertoleum exporting countries racist?
Archer: Oh, that's what it means?
%
Lana's mom: What is it you're studying?
Archer: Um..Medeival-Slavic History
Lem Kane: Really? That must be fascinating
Archer: Well, everyone thinks that but---
Lem Kane: So tell me what are your thoughts on the Battle of Kosovo 1389
Archer: Um, no opinion (squirming his way through the answer)
Lem Kane: Not even as it relates to the rise of Serbian nationalism?
Archer: Um, nope? Also, that's a bit reductionist
%
Archer: Who gets into a hot tub naked with a stranger?
Lana: Because everybody? Because Berkley?!
Archer: How doese a whole city get a pass from acceptable behavior!
%
Cheryl: Oh please, you invented racism? Also, you're just a reconstructed light field produced by firing a razor through a beam splitter..
Krieger's artificial girlfriend: Waaaww!
Pam: Yeah dude, not cool..

Jesus, Mary and Joseph Stalin! For the last time assholes, my name is....Shazam! How do you not remember that show?
%
Ray: To reiterate, I am paralyzed!
Cyril: Well, join a support group.
Malory: For who? Crippled gay hillbilly spies? There's a niche.
%
Archer: Did you just say Gay G B?
Cyril: Aww...do you think it's the mustache?
Ray: It's not helping.
%
Give it time. This isn't the Flintstones. We can't just wang him in the head with a frying pan!
%
Archer: Oh my God!
Lana: What?
Archer: Michael Gray - was Billy Batson on Shazam!
%
Lana: Have you ever heard of ISIS?
Archer: From the Shazam/Isis Hour TV Show?
%
Ray: Ooh! Here's an idea. Why don't you just saw your God damned head off?
Cyril: Geez. What's up your butt?
Ray: Nothing is up my butt, Cyril. Oh, or maybe there is. I wouldn't know because I'm paralyzed from the waist down and it's Archer's fault!
Krieger: Uh, gettin' some mileage out of that, huh?
%
Malory: Duly noted and disregarded. And I expect you to be totally convincing.
Lana: As the damsel in distress? Have you ever met a woman less damselly?
Malory: Pam.
%
If you're having a legitimate problem with your vagina...

%
Archer: Can you put it in a person's brain?
Krieger: It'd suffocate.
Archer: Not the rabbit, you idiot - the chip.
Krieger: Oh yes, absolutely.
Archer: Without killing the person?
Krieger: Oh... maybe?
%
Barry: Don't try anything stupid.
Archer: I don't have to try....  shit, whatever, move.
%
Just try to think about something else like there's no sink in there.
%
Cheryl: You can't control a person's heart.
Krieger: You can with a little something I like to call a deep cycle marine battery... or LSD.
%
Ouch, my earballs.
%
My plan is to crowd source a plan.
%
Barry: Yours for the taking, if you are similarly mine for the taking

Cheryl: Why don't you go back to Jamaica?
Pam: A) Because I got deported.

Malory: And what? You think he wanted to mind control you into loving him?
Archer: You tell me, mother.  That's your speciality!
%
Anka: My hands are really burning.
Archer: Woh. That's first degree frost bite.  Too bad you don't have big mitteny gloves like me.  I can't feel a thing in them.
%
Anka: Are you going to throw that in my face the rest of my life?
Archer: Yeah, all four minutes of it.

Lana: Have you at least babyproofed this place?

%
Archer: Cyril, let's get that sweater vest off buddy
Cyril: I'm sorry?

%
Archer: Come on cyborg. RD2 it.
Ray: R2D2 it?
Archer: Yeah, probe around in there and whatever, shut down the tractor beam.
Ray: With what, my dick?
Archer: I....however you normally do it
Ray: I don't normally do it!
Archer: I know but this is an emergency.
%
Cheryl: I have an idea!
Archer: OK wait. Does it have anything to do with our current situation?
Cheryl: Yes!
Archer: OK, what is it?
Cheryl: We are stuck in an elevator?
Cyril: The idea! Not our current situation!
%
Pam: Psst, Cyril rub one out.
Cyril: I do NOT want to masturbate
Pam: Not even after that (referencing Ray and Lana wrestling)
%
Lana: Remember when the office shut down and we spent an entire year as coke dealers?
Archer: What, so people just quit?
%
Lana: What is it, soup?
Ray: Define soup.
Lana: Would it be safe to assume that no one wants to drink what's in your thermos?
Krieger: Sweet Jesus God, I would hope so!
%
Well then, it's official. The sweater vest is officially good for nothing.
%
Lana: I'm going upstate for seer school
